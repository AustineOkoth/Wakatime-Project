***The project tends to replace the manual data recording of workers and visitors arrival and departure time in organizations and
    replace it with the digital interface. (AM SURE YOU KNOW THE BENEFITS OF USING DIGITAL DATA RECORDS RATHER THAN MANUAL DATA .)

*** Additonally, any guest that enters or leaves the organization is captured and recorded stored in the database.

*** Ensure that you have imported the database attched in this files to ensure that you run the project successfully ****

******The Support Staff section is currently not implemented, the worker and the visitor section are working
perfectly and can be used measre the success of the project. *********
